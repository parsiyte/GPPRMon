Kernel: Betweenness Centrality (BC)
Author: Xuhao Chen

Will return array of approx betweenness centrality scores for each vertex

This BC implementation makes use of the Brandes [1] algorithm with
implementation optimizations from Madduri et al. [2]. It is only an approximate
because it does not compute the paths from every start vertex, but only a small
subset of them. Additionally, the scores are normalized to the range [0,1].

As an optimization to save memory, this implementation uses a Bitmap to hold
succ (list of successors) found during the BFS phase that are used in the back-
propagation phase.
